        <article>
            <p class="article-text"><span style="font-size: 25px;">Another Year- 2024</span><br>Friend- and friends not that I mourn over- It is another year. Millions have died before its coming and millions more have been born to see it come. As fast as the days go- years go just as well. And so again with the new year, we are reminded of our temporary stature as the count ticks. How different things were years ago and how different they can be years later. More importantly, how soon our years will no longer be; as for old age, or a more likely unexpected death. One man may be in the grave as another spills tears over him this year; though all will have their place in these two roles.<strong> As an end is certain for all things earthly</strong>- even the mountains are brought back to sand; and the castle towns of old are long in ruins, voices no longer heard within them.<br><br> (2 Peter 3:5-7) <i>"For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:  {6} Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:  {7} But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men."
</i><br><br>

<span style="font-size: 25px;">Rivers- A Fountain Of Eternal Life</span><br>While this does lead most into despair- like the expeditions of dying kings for a hidden fountain of youth- there is freely offered unending life, employing flowing rivers unseen. Yet, most never seek this eternal life despite hearing of it- for the way it comes is undesired to modern men.<strong> Not that it takes much, but of how little it takes to receive.</strong><br><br><i>(John 7:37-39) "In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.  {38} He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  {39} (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)"</i><br><br>

<span style="font-size: 25px;">Faith- Sight Of That What Is Unseen</span><br>This life comes by faith; <strong>a trust in Jesus’s offering up from the cross and grave- that it has saved us by the path his blood took- like the Old Testament law sacrifices of Israel.</strong> This is a belief in things unpopular and reproached- as for most, the Bible and God are things of times past. Things offensive and laughable- as since the words do not change with time- the societies of man have already changed several, as only evil waxes worse and not his scripture to accommodate with them;<br><br><i>(2 Timothy 3:12-17) "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.  {13} But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.  {14} But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;  {15} And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.  {16} All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:  {17} That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."</i><br><br>Though, for strangers not yet in the holy book, consider this- that such a reality still comes upon those who bother to study the Bible at least a fraction of what they studied in modern science in years of schooling and hobby. I, having been fully convinced at a time- that God was a fabrication- though by simply reading the Bible and hearing the words of others to help teach, I now know the foolish lies of ignorance that I once held onto. By bothering to look, we can eventually see what is unseen through faith through the compounding knowledge and accounts told within the Bible- as how it even paints the very picture of today’s world. This takes faith in knowledge learned- as even the atheist has faith in their worldview that is learned.<strong> But, how does anyone believe in something that they never bother to hear properly? Just as you’ve sat down to study the theory of man, sit down to study the word of God; or who is to blame but ourselves for not hearing?</strong><br><br><i>(Romans 10:14-18) "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  {15} And how shall they preach, except they be sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  {16} But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  {17} So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  {18} But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."</i><br><br>Seek and come with us. Have you not heard of what is said to come to those who remain in disbelief; hell and then the lake of fire? Does not the promise of eternal bliss spark any interest to bother? It was not visions of angels or voices from heaven that have convinced me. The words of the book are all that it took.<strong> Words of the book read by the course of time; time which has been seen recently to have marked off the previous year from our lives; what is left for us to waste in amusement as we gamble our souls for no purpose or rational gain to loss?</strong><br><br>Many have been called to the faith; though few go into it; this straight, narrow gate of the trusting faith. These are those who choose God and place faith in him, his word, and the Word who is him. And so God chose them; as he already knew who would choose him. Be one of them for us; because if a selfish man can ache for the wayward lost and their pain, so does God, as we have already seen:<br><br><i>(Ezekiel 18:31-32) "¶ Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?  {32} For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye."</i><br><br>

<span style="font-size: 25px;">Instruction For The <i>Chosen</i></span><br>For the lost sheep that hear his call- Repent; <strong>Repent from disbelief and into the trust</strong> of Christ’s deliverance- of himself into your place and yourself out of your right death. Trust what he’s done.<br><br><i>(Romans 3:20-30) "Therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.  {21} But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  {22} Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:  {23} For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  {24} Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:  {25} Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God;  {26} To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.  {27} Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.  {28} Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.  {29} Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:  {30} Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."<br><br>(Romans 4:1-8) "What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?  {2} For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.  {3} For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.  {4} Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.  {5} But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.  {6} Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,  {7} Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.  {8} Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."<br><br>(Romans 4:22-25) "And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.  {23} Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;  {24} But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;  {25} Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification."</i><br><br><strong>Read from the apostle Paul’s letters, beginning in Romans and ending in Hebrews.</strong> He is the apostle chosen by God in the book of Acts- sent his way to preach the new gospel to the Gentiles- of salvation by trust alone, “faith in the blood.” Learn why Jesus needed to die- how his death saves (regarding his blood,) and why he needed to rise again- these things will help bolster your trust in Jesus; as your faith should be objective. You can learn all of this from Paul- so take his words first as they are also God’s words.<br><br>Consider this video about how your faith is to be like; a trusting faith and not just an intellectual faith. A trusting to leap and rely solely on what Jesus did:<br><br> <iframe width="600" height="355" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVycI99LUk8?si=iSzJ-7oFtA4oiBf-&amp;start=76" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>If you are currently trusting in works; water baptism, confession of God, or good works being needed to validate salvation;<br><br><ul class="article-text"><li>Baptism- read the (entire) book of Acts and notice the transition of how people are eventually baptized with the Holy Spirit. Anything we do is work- why must we perform a ritual that is only a symbol to enter heaven; is this not trusting in works if you say it is needed to be performed in addition to the faith to be saved?</li><br><li>Confession as stated by Paul- read the rest of Paul and don’t strain at a gnat. It may help to see him explain- that we can’t call if we don’t believe- and that belief is what makes us righteous. To claim we must do anything other than having a trusting faith- to be saved- is actively denying our faith taught by Paul. </li><br><li>Good works- the bane of many would-be Christians who can’t find an objective trust in Christ alone. To keep it short, read Acts to see the transition of how individuals receive the Holy Ghost, then read Paul’s letters- understand that you are a new creation found blameless within the same dying tree; how else could you possibly be at ease with the parable of good trees only producing good fruit and bad trees producing bad fruit? Do you not still sin? Justified and imputed with righteousness by our faith, yes? Consider the many fruits of the spirit- and how faith again is listed as one of them. Know what Paul says about dead works- made by a misguided faith. Consider those from the Church- at the Bema seat who receive no reward because of their lack of real tested fruit- yet are still saved. Consider looking up the term, “Free Grace” which distinguishes salvation from our discipleship. Step out of Lordship Salvation- as it is a faith in works disguised by a failure to rightly divide the word. But yes, do good works after being saved because God desires it of us, we love him, and it’s just right anyway. Just don’t use it as evidence since our trusting faith is not visual by its nature- and our hearts can deceive us in our works as to why we’re doing what we do. </li></ul><br><br></p><p class="article-text"><strong>Learning the topic of dispensations first- will help keep you out of a false denomination that leads to an error of the interpretation of salvation; </strong> many call themselves Christian and consider themselves saved- yet don’t practice the right faith of Jesus’s propitiation and resurrection, that this alone saves them by their trust of it doing so. Dispensations will also help clarify how to divide the word for us today- <u>and later</u>.<br><br><i>(2 Timothy 2:15-18) "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.  {16} But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.  {17} And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;  {18} Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."</i><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOLBx1jtxMs?si=fzcMLgBHVDUJ53fj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>It’s also good to hear why we still don't do the <i>“snip, snip”</i> of our <u>willy dillies</u>- like the Jews have been doing since Abraham. :)<br><br>
